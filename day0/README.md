* to learn about functional programming through the lens of a lisp
* we're going to see how functional abstractions are a "good" way of designing
 programs

##crash course to lisp

* parens and what they mean
* function calls
* "values"
* literals
* conditions (also functions)
* recursion and tail calls

##about clojure

* why clojure?
* major differences that you should know
   - vectorized function parameters
   - defn vs define
   - varargs & vs .

##set up environment

* mac users `brew install leiningen` (installs jvm if necessary)
* windows
* intellij (la clojure or cursive), lighttable, [http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/](emacs), vi
* open repl
* try hello world `(prn "hello world")`

##where to get the book

* [https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html](html online)
